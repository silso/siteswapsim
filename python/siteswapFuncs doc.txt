##SITESWAP TRANSLATOR
	##SYNTAX CHECKER
		Uses regex to validate the formatting of the siteswap.
		Strings are used to make the regular expression easier to understand,
			though it is in fact just one pattern that the siteswap has to match.
		Regex pattern in one line:(^((\d|[a-w])|\[(\d|[a-w])+\])+$)|(^(\((((\d|[a-w])x?)|\[((\d|[a-w])x?)+\]),(((\d|[a-w])x?)|\[((\d|[a-w])x?)+\])\))+$)

	##STAR-GET-RID-OF'R
		In siteswap, * repeats the whole sync siteswap but with the hands swapped:
			eg. (6x,4)* = (6x,4)(4,6x)
		New string is set equal to old string, minus the *.
		Add '(', ',' and ')' manually.
		When on left side of old string (located where the x is in (x,6)), save to temp string.
		When on right side of old string (located where the x is in (6,x)), copy directly to left side of new string.
		When done with right side of old string, add on temp string.
		Repeat previous 3 steps until through all of old string.

	##TRANSLATOR
		##SYNC
			Since siteswap is already validated for formatting,
				we can pull out the numbers with the assumption that the parentheses and commas are correct.
			Sync pattern will be converted into an async format (a sequential array). Because of this, we change crossing
				throws into odd numbers to simulate the throws going to the other hand.
			However, if must increase the throws on one hand to an odd number, we must decrese the throws on the other hand,
				in order to keep the throws landing at the right time.
				This makes the pattern lopsided, but it works well for testing.
			For every throw, check next char to see if it is an x. If it is,
				we check the char behind to see where we are in the sync beat. If it is a '(',
				we are on the left, so we add 1. Otherwise, we subtract 1.

		##VANILLA
			This part adds non-multiplex throws to the siteswap array. If we are not sync, 'add' will always be 0.
			If we are sync, 'add' will depend on which hand we are thrown from.

		##MULTIPLEX
			There is a nested while loop for the multiplex since there are extra conditions we are looking for.
			'multiplexStart' lets the while loop know where the start of the multiplex is, so it can check if it's
				on the left or right side of the sync beat.
			'add'
